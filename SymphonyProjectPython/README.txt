In case of running web app automation part, be sure to specify path to 
the folder that contains chromedriver since i installed it locally. 
Open the project in Python and simply run it from console or which ever way you prefer.
To point out i wasnt able to implement the : Thumbnail - post any image feature in my 
automated test script. I believe everything else should work fine. 
Regarding the 2nd part of challenge i.e services testing, well i didnt do much there as
you will see. Those 5 days sadly werent enough for me to prepare for that part. 

However this ends I'm thankful for opportunity given. 
Kind regards
